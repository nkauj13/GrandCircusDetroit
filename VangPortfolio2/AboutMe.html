<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>My name is Gaoia (it's pronounced like "Gow-ee-uh") Vang and I'm a 25 year old currently studying to become a front-end web developer. <br><br>
I had originally graduated with a BA in Advertising from Michigan State University in 2013, but after a few years I realized I didn't want to pursue a career down that path. 
I grew interest in web development around six months ago. It wasn't until recent that I decided to finally create some portfolios. This will be my first test. <br><br>

<p>Besides studying web development, I also enjoy watching movies, eating, and my latest obession is the Pokemon Go game app. (Muk is currently my most powerful CP Pokemon)</p>
